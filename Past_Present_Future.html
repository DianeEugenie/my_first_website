                <p>Born and raised in the Netherlands, where I lived for over 20 years.
                  I decided to move to the United Kingdom after finishing my degree in Linguistics from Leiden University.
                  Not ready to face adulthood just yet, I decided to become an au-pair in London.
                </p>
                <p>Within a couple of weeks there, I become a host/co-organizer for a social event.
                  The event was created for language learners to come together and explore London and its surrounding areas.
                </p>
                <p>After my au-pair days, I worked for a printing company with its international office in Ealing, London.
                  In June 2016, the company moved this office back to Germany. Shortly after, I found a job as a customer
                  service advisor for the LEGO Group where I stayed for over a year and a half.

                <p>Currenty, enrolled at CodeClan to start a new career path.
                  My aim is to return to my language learning and linguistic roots. This time I will be delving into the world of artificial languages.
                  It is not completely unknown to me, as I have dipped my toes into the ocean that is programming languages before as well as fictional
                  languages like Na'vi (Avatar) and Klingon (Star Trek).
                </p>
                <p>I would like to find a career in the field where linguistics and computer languages meet.
                  My interests in the field of computing are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Computational Linguistics.

              <p>In the future, I hope to be a programming wiz working for a company that is trying to better the world, especially environmentally so.
                Hopefully, with the opportunity to travel to different countries and/or work remotely.
                On the side, I will have created a couple of educational games that help people, especially children, understand the world we live in.
                Whichever country I end up in is not really of any importance. I will be willing to move wherever is needed, provided that my partner is okay with it too.
